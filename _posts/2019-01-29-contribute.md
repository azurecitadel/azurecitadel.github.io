# Azure Citadel

I think we have worked through the remaining teething difficulties and the site is in good health. Thanks to those of you who have picked up on issues and let us know.  It is always appreciated.

A few key updates

## Disqus comments

We managed to retain the comments from the old site, but pages without comments weren't loading.  This is now fixed so we look forward to hearing your questions, comments and suggestions!

## Contributing to Citadel

As a community site, we welcome corrections and contributions to the content.

Please read the new [contributing ](https://azurecitadel.com/contributing) pages to guide you through how it all works.  We haven't got designated content owners for each category yet, so if it isn't obvious on a category page then contact either Ben or I via the comments or via GitHub.

Right, now that is all done and dusted we can create some of that new content we've been promising!
