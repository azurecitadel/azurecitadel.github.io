Azure API Management is a solution for publishing APIs to external and internal customers. You can quickly create consistent and modern API gateways for existing back-end services hosted anywhere, secure and protect them from abuse and overuse, and get insights into usage and health. Plus, automate and scale developer onboarding to help get API solutions up and running.

In this lab we explore the use of Azure API Management.
