## Registering Providers

As AKS is in preview you might need to register the `Microsoft.ContainerService` provider in your subscription. Additionally if this is a new subscription created from an Azure Pass or trial, the core `Network`, `Storage` & `Compute` providers may not be registered.  
Run the following commands to ensure all four providers are enabled:
```
az provider register -n Microsoft.Network
az provider register -n Microsoft.Storage
az provider register -n Microsoft.Compute
az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService
```

## Deploying AKS
We will begin by deploying Kubernetes using [*Azure Container Service (AKS)*](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/) (for the rest of the document we will simply refer to it as AKS)

**💬 Note.** At the time of writing (Mar 2018) AKS is in preview and the only Azure regions where AKS can be deployed are: 
- westeurope
- eastus
- centralus
- canadacentral
- canadaeast  

> Pick a location and use it for everything you create in this lab. We will use **westeurope**, but you can use one of the other regions listed above if you wish. If using an Azure Pass or Internal Use subscription, you will be limited to westeurope and eastus

Using the Azure CLI creating an AKS cluster is easy. First create a resource group:
```
az group create -n kube-lab -l westeurope
```

The most basic form of the AKS create command using all the defaults is simply:
```
az aks create -g kube-lab -n aks-cluster -l westeurope
```

However you will probably want to customize your cluster, some common options are:
- **\-\-node-count** - Number of nodes in your cluster
- **\-\-node-vm-size** - Azure VM size (e.g. `Standard_A2_v2`)
- **\-\-kubernetes-version** - Kubernetes version (run `az aks get-versions -o table` to list available versions)

[📘 AKS Create docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create){:target="_blank" class="btn-info"}

> **📕 Kubernetes Glossary.** A *Node* is a worker machine in Kubernetes, it hosts the workloads in your cluster and runs the containers

A recommended cluster configuration for this lab is as follows:
```
az aks create -g kube-lab -n aks-cluster -l westeurope --node-count 3 --node-vm-size Standard_B2ms --kubernetes-version 1.9.6 --verbose
```
This is a three node cluster, running Kubernetes 1.9.6 using B-Series burstable VMs to minimize costs  

**💬 Note 1.** The `az aks create` command uses your default SSH keypair located in **~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub** to provision the cluster nodes. If these keys don't exist (likely if you've never used WSL Bash or the Cloud Shell before) then you must add `--generate-ssh-keys` to the command. If you have your own SSH keys you wish to use, then add the `--ssh-key-value` parameter and provide the key public contents as a string

**💬 Note 2.** The command might take some time to complete, around 30 mins is normal, but in some cases up to an hour.

**💬 Note 3.** To save costs you can optionally enable auto-shutdown on the node VMs. Find the resource group named **MC_kube-lab_aks-cluster_westeurope** this will contain your cluster's nodes and other Azure resources. Click on each of the VMs and switch on the auto shutdown feature. You will need to manually start them again when you want to use your cluster, which might take around 5 mins, but having the nodes shutdown you can keep your AKS cluster deployed indefinitely for essentially zero cost


## Get Kubectl CLI tool (WSL Bash Only)
To access the Kubernetes system you will be using the standard Kubernetes `kubectl` command line tool. We will be using this command a lot and it allows complete control and administration of a Kubernetes cluster.  

If you are using *Azure Cloud Shell* you can skip this part as `kubectl` is already installed, so you can jump to **Accessing your Cluster**

To download the `kubectl` binary run:
```
sudo az aks install-cli --client-version 1.9.6
```

Test the command has been installed and is in your path by simply running `kubectl`

## Accessing your Cluster
In order to access and manage Kubernetes `kubectl` command works off a set of cached credentials, held in the **.kube** directory your user profile/homedir. The Azure CLI makes getting these credentials for your AKS instance easy. This command effectively "logs you in" to Kubernetes:
```
az aks get-credentials -g kube-lab -n aks-cluster
```

## Sanity Check Kubernetes and AKS
It is recommended run the following to check your cluster is up and operational.
```
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```
You should see information about your cluster and then information about each of the nodes you requested when you built the cluster (e.g. three) and their status, which should be **Ready**


Another good check to run is listing all the pods running, in the `kube-system` namespace:
```
kubectl get all -n kube-system
```
> **📕 Kubernetes Glossary.** A *Namespace* is abstraction used by Kubernetes to support multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster. Think of it as a kind of multi-tenancy. For this lab we will be deploying our app to the **default** namespace


## Access Kubernetes Dashboard 
Accessing the Kubernetes dashboard is optional, but if it's your first time using Kubernetes it can help provide a lot of visibility into what is going on. 

For the lab we will use the command line for everything, and all commands will be provided. However it is useful to be able to sanity check and see what is going on using the dashboard. It's a matter of personal choice if you want to use the dashboard, but it's worth having to hand for triaging problems and investigation.

### Option 1 - Using WSL Bash 
If using WSL Bash on your local machine, the dashboard can be accessed via a proxy tunnel into the Kubernetes cluster itself. To create this proxy:
```
az aks browse -g kube-lab -n aks-cluster
```
To access the dashboard go to [http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001) in your browser. 

**💬 Note 1.** This command doesn't return to the prompt when executed, so run it in a new window or terminal

**💬 Note 2.**  It is fairly common for the proxy to drop after short periods of inactivity, so be prepared to re-start the `az aks browse` command if the dashboard stops responding

### Option 2 - Using Cloud Shell
If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell `az aks browse` will not work as it creates a tunnel to localhost. Your only option is to expose the dashboard publicly. **Normally this is not a recommend approach** as there is *no authentication on the dashboard*, however for a lab and short term use it will suffice. 

We will limit access to just your current public IP address, with a firewall (Azure NSG) to prevent it being completely open to the entire internet. This is a very brittle configuration but provides some degree of security

Visit http://whatismyip.host/ and get your IPv4 address

Then run the following Bash snippet, but modify the section `put-your-ip-here` with the real IP address
```
kubectl expose deployment kubernetes-dashboard --port=80 --target-port=9090 --type=LoadBalancer --name dash-external -n kube-system --overrides='{ "apiVersion": "v1", "spec": { "loadBalancerSourceRanges" : ["put-your-ip-here/32"] } }'
```
This will expose your dashboard on a new public IP, and configure the firewall 

To get the assigned IP to access your dashboard run the command  
```
kubectl get svc/dash-external -n kube-system
```
Check the output for the EXTERNAL-IP. If you have just created your AKS cluster it could take around 5 minutes before the external IP address is assigned. Keep running the command and checking.

Once the IP is assigned, access the dashboard by simply going to that IP in your browser.

**💬 Note.**  Should your public IP change for what ever reason or you want to open up the firewall to other IPs/ranges you will need to run `KUBE_EDITOR="nano" kubectl edit svc/dash-external -n kube-system` and you can modify the **loadBalancerSourceRanges** section 

Later in the lab we will explain in more detail about exposed services like this, and what they are doing, but for now we can move on.


## End of Module 1
With an AKS cluster deployed and operational we're in a position to start using it, next we'll prepare the images we need and then look at deploying them to Kubernetes
