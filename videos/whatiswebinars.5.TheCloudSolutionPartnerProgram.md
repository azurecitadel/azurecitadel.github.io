Join me, Azure Dan, for my fortnightly webinar series where I will be discussing the topics requested by our partners and where Microsoft can help.

----------

## The Cloud Solution Partner Program

In this episode I am joined by [Jan Mietle](https://twitter.com/janmietle) as we discuss the Cloud and the Microsoft CSP Program, which enables Partners to white label Microsoft Cloud Services and own the end-to-end relationship with customers.
