Let Azure Dan take you through some of the key business outcomes that organisations benefit from when moving workloads to the cloud especially when those companies modernise their applications in tandem with their development and operational processes.

This updated 2h 40m video will take you through a whistle stop tour of key Azure services, and you can watch as Dan uses a selection of those to create a company in the cloud.

Grab your [Azure free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/) subscription and join Dan on this fantastic introduction to what can be achieved on a hyperscale cloud, and gain an insight into some of the interfaces that will help you to gain control over cloud infrastructure and platform services.
